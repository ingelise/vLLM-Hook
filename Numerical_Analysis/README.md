# vLLM Hidden State Extraction

## Overview

This report benchmarks **vLLM-Hook** vs. **Native vLLM Eagle** (`ExampleHiddenStatesConnector`) for hidden state extraction. Both systems extract intermediate transformer hidden states during inference that would enable supports for activation steering, probing classifiers, etc.

## What Have We Compared

- **Number of layers:** 1 to all
- **Length of prompts:** around 16, 64, 256, 512 tokens
- **Extraction modes:**
    | System | Token Mode | Description |
    |--------|-----------|-------------|
    | vLLM-Hook | `last_token` | Extracts the last-token hidden state per prompt per layer |
    | vLLM-Hook | `all_tokens` | Extracts hidden states for all tokens per prompt per layer |
    | Native vLLM Eagle | N/A (effectively `all_token`) | Built-in extraction via `ExampleHiddenStatesConnector` |

## Key Findings

![Grid Summary](plots/grid_summary.png)

*Four metrics across 4 prompt lengths (rows) and 28 layer counts (x-axis). Shaded bands show ± standard deviation over 10 runs.*


### 1. At low layer counts, all three systems perform comparably

When extracting hidden states from only a few layers (~1–4), all three systems show similar generation latency regardless of prompt length. For example, at 1 layer, vLLM-Hook (`last_token`) = 20.3 ms, vLLM-Hook (`all_tokens`) = 21.2 ms, and native vLLM Eagle = 21.3 ms (16-token prompt).

### 2. vLLM-Hook (`last_token`) has the lowest and flattest latency overhead

vLLM-Hook (`last_token`) adds only **1.5–2×** overhead from 1 to 28 layers, independent of prompt length. At 512 tokens and 28 layers it takes **55.6 ms** — compared to **263.8 ms** for vLLM-Hook (`all_tokens`) and **284.2 ms** for native Eagle. This makes it the best choice when only the final-position representation is needed. For example, when one needs hidden states from all layers, we have

| Prompt length | vLLM-Hook (`last_token`) | vLLM-Hook (`all_tokens`) | native vLLM Eagle |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 16 tokens | 30.8 ms | 53.0 ms | 28.6 ms |
| 64 tokens | 31.2 ms | 85.0 ms | 45.0 ms |
| 256 tokens | 49.4 ms | 172.4 ms | 115.7 ms |
| 512 tokens | 55.6 ms | 263.8 ms | 284.2 ms |

vLLM-Hook (`last_token`) slices to the last token at capture time inside the worker, so only a single `(hidden_size,)` vector per layer is written to disk, regardless of prompt length. Native vLLM and stores all prompt tokens and all layers together.

### 3. Artifact size for last_token is prompt-length invariant

vLLM-Hook (`last_token`) produces a flat **652 KB** artifact regardless of prompt length, since it stores only one vector per prompt per layer. This is 16–510× smaller than `all_tokens` or native Eagle at long sequences, making it suitable for high-throughput scenarios where storage or I/O bandwidth is a bottleneck.

### 4. Native vLLM Eagle carries a ~3.75 GB GPU memory overhead

Native vLLM `ExampleHiddenStatesConnector` is built on Eagle-3 speculative decoding infrastructure, which requires loading a dummy drafter model. In practice this reduces the available KV cache by ~2.3 GiB (vLLM-Hook: ~65.96 GiB available; native: ~63.64 GiB available).

## Reproduction
**Model:** Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct  
**Hardware:** Single GPU (A100/H100 class, ~74 GB VRAM)  
**Environment:**
- vLLM 0.18.0, PyTorch 2.10.0+cu129
- `VLLM_USE_V1=1` (v1 engine)
- `VLLM_WORKER_MULTIPROC_METHOD=spawn`
- `VLLM_USE_AOT_COMPILE=0` (required workaround: PyTorch 2.10.0 does not support `aot_compile` as called by vLLM 0.18.0's compilation pipeline)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirement.txt
pip install -e vllm_hook_plugins

## Artifact Verification

To verify that vLLM-Hook (`all_tokens`) produces the same hidden states as Native vLLM Eagle:

```bash
python benchmarks/verify_artifact_parity.py
```
This runs both systems on the same 8 prompts, extracts all 20 layers, and compares tensors token-by-token. vLLM-Hook (`all_tokens`) mode was verified to produce numerically equivalent hidden states to Native vLLM Eagle (cosine similarity > 0.994, more or less within float16 precision bounds)
